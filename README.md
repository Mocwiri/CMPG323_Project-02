# CMPG323_Project-02
My ASP.NET Core Web API the way is structure is in a way that firsty for the stakeholder to be able to access my API they must firstly register and before that I/they must register an admin to oversee the whole process of registering the users of the API.
Another factor to see is that to access items on the database you can check,delete and also insert data into the database.
Since I couldnt create the controllers for you to be able to check,delete and also insert data into the database you can make sure that your authentication data needed is inserted properly into the database and your password should be save as a token in the database in some table.
The are some issues also with the Authentication process but it can run and and use swagger are the prerequisite desires. Another thing is all the extentions that are needed and the scaffolding that was required all that was created and for security purposes the connection string together with the Username and Password required all was move and saved accordingly and where they were suppose to be.
One thing is all that is needed to be installed and push and pull all that was done and is working.
